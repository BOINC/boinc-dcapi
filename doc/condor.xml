  <title>Application in Condor environment</title>

  <para>
  Master-worker application developed using DC-API can be run in a
  Condor environment. The master program must be started by hand and
  it submits workunits to a Condor execution pool.
  </para>

  <para>
  All files that generated by the application including the master and
  the worker programs and the DC-API library itself are placed under a
  directory called <emphasis>working directory</emphasis>.
  </para>

  <title>Condor environment</title>

  <para>
  To execute a DC-API application using Condor version of the DC-API
  library you have to set up a Condor environment and have access to
  it.
  </para>

  <para>
  Master program of the application must be started on a Condor submit
  host so it will be able to submit workunits as Condos jobs.
  </para>

  <para>
  Working directory of the application must be accessible by the
  master and the worker processes too so it should be placed on a
  shared filesystem (e.g. NFS) which is available for the submit and
  the execution hosts in the Condor pool.
  </para>

  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="condor_required">
  <title>Required tools</title>

  <para>
  To compile the application using Condor version of the DC-API
  library you need an additional library <filename
  class="library">libcondorapi.a</filename> which is included in the
  Condor installation. This library must be linked to the application
  besides the DC-API library.
