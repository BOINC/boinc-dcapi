<!-- ##### ENUM DC_ErrorCode ##### -->
<para>
Error codes returned by DC-API functions.
</para>

@DC_OK: no error.
@DC_ERR_CONFIG: configuration error (syntax error, illegal or missing values).
@DC_ERR_DATABASE: database error.
@DC_ERR_NOTIMPL: the function is not implemented.
@DC_ERR_UNKNOWN_WU: the work unit is not known to DC-API.
@DC_ERR_TIMEOUT: the operation timed out.
@DC_ERR_BADPARAM: the function was passed illegal parameters.
@DC_ERR_SYSTEM: a system call has failed, check errno for the reason.
@DC_ERR_INTERNAL: an internal error occured in DC-API.

<!-- ##### ENUM DC_GridCapabilities ##### -->
<para>
These flags define the capabilities of the underlying grid system.
</para>

@DC_GC_EXITCODE: the client's exit code is propagated to the master.
@DC_GC_STDOUT: the client's standard output is sent back to the master.
@DC_GC_STDERR: the client's standard error is sent back to the master.
@DC_GC_LOG: infrastructure-specific log files are available.
@DC_GC_SUSPEND: suspending of work units is supported.
@DC_GC_SUBRESULT: subresults are supported.
@DC_GC_MESSAGING: message sending is supported.

<!-- ##### ENUM DC_FileMode ##### -->
<para>
Tells how should DC-API treat physical files passed to it.
</para>

@DC_FILE_REGULAR: the application wishes to continue using the file, so DC-API
	must make an internal copy of it.
@DC_FILE_PERSISTENT: the application guarantees that the file will not change
	and will not be deleted during the lifetime of the application. This
	lets DC-API use symbolic or hard links instead of copying to save space.
@DC_FILE_VOLATILE: the application does not want to use the file in any way in
	the future. DC-API will remove the file when it is no longer needed.

<!-- ##### MACRO DC_CONFIG_FILE ##### -->
<para>
Default name of the DC-API configuration file.
</para>



<!-- ##### FUNCTION DC_getMaxMessageSize ##### -->
<para>
Returns the maximum length of a message that the master can send using
DC_sendWUMessage() to clients.
</para>

@Returns: the maximum allowed message size.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION DC_getMaxSubresults ##### -->
<para>
Returns the maximum number of sub-result files the master can specify when
creating a new work unit.
</para>

@Returns: the number of sub-results allowed.


<!-- ##### FUNCTION DC_getGridCapabilities ##### -->
<para>
Determines the capabilities of the underlying grid infrastructure.
</para>

@Returns: the appropriate #DC_GridCapabilities constants OR'ed together.
